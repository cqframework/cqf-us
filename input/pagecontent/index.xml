  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This implementation guide contains common FHIR assets for use in US-based content IGs
    built using the approach and specifications developed as part of the Clinical
    Quality Framework (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/Clinical+Quality+Framework">CQF</a>)
    initiative, including the USCore-ModelInfo and USCommon libraries.</p>

  <a name="contents"> </a>
  <h3>Contents</h3>
  <p>This implementation guide contains libraries that facilitate the use of CQL with FHIR in the US Realm, 
  with an initial use case of Prior Authorization Support Questionnaires as described in the 
  <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr/">DaVinci Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR)</a> implementation guide.

  <h5>Data Flow</h5>
  <p>The questionnaire examples and associated libraries for population expressions in this IG are expected to be used in the following data flow:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Coverage Requirements Discovery CDS Hooks interaction response will include a Coverage resource that is then used to parameterize the DTR request</li>
    <li>The DTR <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-dtr/OperationDefinition-questionnaire-package.html">$questionnaire-package operation</a> has context parameters such as the Coverage and Request resources associated with the prior-authorization</li>
    <li>The prior-authorization application then uses the population expressions in the resulting Questionnaire to perform population, for example using the SDC <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition-Questionnaire-populate.html">$questionnaire-populate</a> operation</li>
  </ul>

  FIXME: Remove this comment before merging.
  
  Next Agenda:

  * Finish review of Patient Patterns
  * Discuss Data Flow and Use Cases (Prior Auth/PAS/CDEX)
  * Start Lab Results with an eye toward establishing a methodology for working through the profiles

  TODO: Look at this: https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=161060105

  TODO: Also need to consider the PAS and CDeX use cases (need concrete examples of both of these and should establish consistent parameterization approach)

  TODO: Make clear that the content and questionnaires in this IG are expected to already have resolved the question of coverage determination, by the time we get here if prior authorization is not required, we won't land here, and are focused on a particular individual (Member ID).
  TODO: Document that SubscriberID is an available element, but would be expected to be the SubscriberID associated with the already established Member ID (individual) (i.e. SubscriberId is the Plan-level identifier for an individual that has the plan, whereas MemberId is specific to the individual beneficiaries of the plan)
  TODO: Consider the ACO use case? At this point we're thinking this is handled behind the scenes (i.e. transparent to the user and therefore this process)
  TODO: For the last step (the questionnaire population), determine exactly how the context parameters will be provided to the operation (because that directly impacts how that information would be accessed within the CQL content).

  <h5>Patient</h5>
  <p>The following page provides patterns for accessing patient-level information in a questionnaire:</p>
  <a href="patterns-patient.html">Patient Patterns</a>

  <a name="usage"> </a>
  <h4>Usage</h4>
  <p>To use these libraries in your implementation guide, include a reference to this implementation guide as
    an implementation guide dependency:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;dependsOn id=&quot;cqf-us&quot;&gt;
  &lt;uri value=&quot;http://fhir.org/guides/cqf/us/common/ImplementationGuide/fhir.cqf.us.common&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;packageId value=&quot;fhir.cqf.us.common&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;version value=&quot;0.1.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/dependsOn&gt;</code></pre>

  <a name="uscore-modelinfo"> </a>
  <h4>USCore ModelInfo</h4>
  <p>Clinical Quality Language (<a href="http://cql.hl7.org">CQL</a>) is a high-level,
  domain-specific language focused on clinical quality and targeted at measure and
  decision support artifact authors. In addition, the CQL specification provides a
  machine-readable canonical representation called Expression Logical Model
  (<a href="https://cql.hl7.org/04-logicalspecification.html">ELM</a>) targeted at
  implementations and designed to enable automated sharing of clinical knowledge.</p>
  <p>To use CQL with USCore, <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/07-physicalrepresentation.html#data-model-references">model
  information</a> must be provided to the implementation environment. The <a href="Library-USCore-ModelInfo.html">USCore-ModelInfo</a>
  library provides this information for US Core. To use USCore, include a <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/02-authorsguide.html#data-models">using
  declaration</a> as shown in the example below:</p>
  <pre><code>using USCore version '3.1.1'</code></pre>
  <p>Although not required by CQL, current best-practice is to include the version of USCore.</p>
